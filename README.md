# Creating-Components-Based-on-Dialogue
This application focuses on simplifying the construction process of BS, BP, and BO, breaking down the cumbersome barriers of traditional interface configuration, and providing users with efficient and convenient solutions. The core supports two core functions: dialogue based addition of new components. No need for complex operations, quickly complete initialization and deployment; Dialogue based interaction design, without the need for professional coding skills, allows for the addition, parameter setting, and debugging of interface services through natural language communication, significantly reducing the threshold for interface configuration. Adapt applications to various product scenarios, help developers and operators save time and costs, improve interface construction efficiency, achieve lightweight and intelligent management of interface services, make interface configuration simpler, and empower products to iterate and upgrade quickly.
